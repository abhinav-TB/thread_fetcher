1. Follow the bot [@threadfetcher on twitter](https://twitter.com/threadfetcher) (The bot will not have the permission to send you a dm if this step is not done)
2. Find a thread you need to save and tag the bot in reply to any of the tweet in the thread (The bot will give you an error message as reply if the tweet does not have any thread)
3. Wait for a couple of seconds for the bot to process the tweet and voil√†! your thread formated and hosted as a web page and the link for the same is sent to you as a direct message
4. You can open the webpage to see all the text, video, images, and gifs in the thread with an additional option to download the pdf of the same
